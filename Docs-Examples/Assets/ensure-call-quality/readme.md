# Ensure call quality

This folder holds the script to test call quality features. To test the call quality features, do the following:

1. **Bind your script to the canvas**

    In **Unity Editor**, Go to the **Asset** folder and drag and drop `GetStarted.cs` to `EventSystem` on the **Hierarchy**.

    Make sure, no other script is added to `EventSystem`.

1. **Test the Implementation**

    To test your implementation, follow [Test your implementation](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/develop/ensure-call-quality?platform=unity#test-your-implementation).
