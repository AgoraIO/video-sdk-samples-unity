# Secure channel encryption

Media stream encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel can see and hear each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires media stream encryption, Video Calling provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.
