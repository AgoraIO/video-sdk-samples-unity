# Get started with Agora Video SDK

This folder contains the necessary files, user interface elements, and the Agora implementation logic that are required to implement real-time interaction features. To run this project, do the following:

1. **Integrate the video SDK**

    Follow [Integrate the video SDK](https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-unity/tree/main/Docs-Examples#integrate-the-video-sdk) steps in order to add the video SDK into your project. If you already added the video SDK, you can skip this step.

1. **Bind your script to the event system**

    In **Unity Editor**, go to the  `Assets\get-started-sdk` folder and drag and drop `GetStarted.cs` to `EventSystem` on the **Hierarchy**.

1. **Test the Implementation**

    To test your implementation, follow [Test your implementation](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/get-started-sdk?platform=unity#test-your-implementation).
