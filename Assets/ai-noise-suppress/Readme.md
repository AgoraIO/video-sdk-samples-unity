# AI noise suppression

Agora's AI Noise Suppression enables you to suppress hundreds of types of noise and reduce distortion in human voices when multiple people speak at the same time. In scenarios such as online meetings, online chat rooms, video consultations with doctors, and online gaming, AI Noise Suppression makes virtual communication as smooth as face-to-face interaction.

AI Noise Suppression reduces the following types of noise:

* Television
* Kitchen
* Street, such as birds chirping, traffic, and subway sounds
* Machines, such as fans, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, and copiers
* Offices, such as keyboard and mouse clicks
* Households, such as doors opening, creaking chairs, crying babies, and house renovations
* Constant knocking
* Beeps and clapping
* Music

This sample project shows you how to enable AI noise suppression in your client.
